# NVidia code removal reasoning

This fork aims to remove all NVidia code, as NVidia is a really bad company that has made it much harder for Linux to prosper, due to them not open-sourcing their drivers, making computers with NVidia GPUs very unstable on both Windows and Linux, compared to computers with AMD GPUs.

This fork is intended for people who don't use NVidia, but use AMD64, Intel64, or other non-NVidia architectures instead. It slightly removes bloat, and makes the project a bit better.
